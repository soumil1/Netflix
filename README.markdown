This React based web page is created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to demostrate Netflix. It utilizes [TMDB API Endpoints](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for fetching data.

<br>

The Netflix Clone project aims to recreate the user interface and basic functionality of the popular streaming platform, Netflix. It is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with React.js. Users can browse through a collection of movies and TV shows, watch posters, and view their details fetched from the TMDB API.
